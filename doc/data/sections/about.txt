Lightweight user framework, written in PHP. PotatoSeed makes it easy to implement an online user system while remaining small.

Ideal for creating web scripts and web-sites that require a user login system.

Potato Seed is still actively being developed and refined, but the scope of the project is to provide a framework that will allow for a small, but powerful user system. It also provides methods and basic strucutres for more general areas of development -- such as sanatising strings -- but only where such methods benefit the writing of the user framework.
